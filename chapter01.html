    <p>One of my current favorite beverages is a highball made using Crown Royal blended whiskey and Pepsi cola. This drink was introduced to me at golf course bar when I was visiting my cousin. I was surprised to learn that the cola used for the drink was Pepsi, considering most alcoholic beverages that use cola call for Coca-Cola. The bar only had Pepsi brand sodas on hand. I really liked the drink regardless. Blended Canadian whiskey is often on the sweeter side of similar spirits like bourbon, scotch, and other forms of whiskey. I think it pairs great with an already sweet beverage, like cola. I liked the drink so much, I have gone home and recreated the drink on my own.</p>
