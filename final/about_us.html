        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h3>How We Began</h3>
        <p>
            Over 15 years ago, <span class="resort">Pacific Trails Resort</span> started off as an 
            itty bitty hotel located on the coast west of Los Angeles called the Pacific Hotel. We specialized in making a wonderful 
            breakfast for our loyal customers. The Pacific Hotel was often had all of our rooms full. Our guests noted how wonderful the scenery was at the hotel, 
            and they started asking if there were any hiking trails they could go out on. It was at this point 
            that we realized that our hotel was more than just a hotel. We used our savings to path various hiking trails, 
            purchase kayaks for guest use, and build yurts so you could be as close to nature as possible, ultimately 
            turning in the Pacific Trails Resort so many of our guests love today.
        </p>
